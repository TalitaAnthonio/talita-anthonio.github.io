## Short bio 
I am a 2nd year PhD student in Computational Linguistics at the University of Stuttgart ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª . My research interests include machine learning, semantics and explainability 
in NLP. My PhD is about modeling potential sources of misunderstandings in instructional texts. Before my PhD, I studied Computational Linguistics (EM-LCT) 
at the University of Groningen ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± and the University of the Basque Country ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸. I also have a MA in Digital Humanities and a BA in Communication and Information Studies,
both obtained from the University of Groningen ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±.
