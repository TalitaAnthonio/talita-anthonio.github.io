I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Stuttgart :de: .
My research interests include: machine learning, semantics and explainability 
in NLP. My thesis is about linguistically informed computational modeling of 
misunderstandings. Before my PhD, I studied Computational Linguistics (LCT Program) 
at the University of Groningen :nl: and the University of the Basque Country. 
I also have a MA in Digital Humanities and a BA in Communication and Information Studies,
both obtained from the University of Groningen.
